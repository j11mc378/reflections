What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A .git folder is create with info needed for git to work properly once we're ready to use it.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
The working directory is a non-git related storage location in the computer where the files are.
The repository is part of git and is used to track files. The staging area just marks files
in the computer as possible files to be tracked in git later on.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
You can use commit diff to compare staging to working directory to compare files
